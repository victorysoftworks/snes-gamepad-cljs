# SNES Gamepad

A ClojureScript library providing a simple event handler interface for using USB SNES gamepads in HTML5 game projects.

Version: `1.1.0`

For more on the :video_game: Gamepad API, see https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/ and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API.

## Quick Start

The SNES Gamepad library allows you to bind handler functions to SNES gamepad events, such as `on-connected` or `on-start-button-pressed`.

```clojure
(ns your.app.namespace
  (:require [snes-gamepad.mapping :as button-mapping]
            [snes-gamepad.gamepad :as snes-gamepad]))

(-> (snes-gamepad/snes-gamepad button-mapping/kiwitata)
    (snes-gamepad/on-connected #(.log js/console "SNES gamepad connected!"))
    (snes-gamepad/on-disconnected #(.log js/console "SNES gamepad disconnected."))
    (snes-gamepad/on-b-button-pressed #(.log js/console "Samus jumps into the air!"))
     snes-gamepad/enable!)
```

## Manually Reading Pressed Buttons

If you need to read the list of pressed gamepad buttons manually, you can do so with the `pressed-buttons!` function.

```clojure
(snes-gamepad/pressed-buttons! gamepad)
```

The `pressed-buttons!` function returns an vector of keywords representing each button that is currently pressed:

```clojure
[:up :down :left :right :a :b :x :y :left-bumper :right-bumper :select :start]
```

If no buttons are being pressed on the gamepad, or if there is no gamepad connected, this function returns an empty vector.

You are encouraged to place your manual checking for button presses inside an `on-connected` callback, preferably within a `js/setInterval` or `js/requestAnimationFrame` function that can be cancelled if the `on-disconnected` callback fires.

## Function Reference

| Function                   | Parameters             | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `snes-gamepad`             | `button-mapping`       | Returns an SNES gamepad with the given button mapping and no button press handlers.                                                                |
| `enable!`                  | None                   | Enables a connected SNES gamepad. If no gamepad is connected, the browser will wait for one to be connected before firing an `on-connected` event. |
| `disable!`                 | None                   | Disables an SNES gamepad. The browser will stop listening for gamepad connections and button press events until `enable!` is called.               |                                                                                    |

## Available Mappings

The SNES Gamepad library comes with two button mappings in the `snes-gamepad.mapping` namespace:

- `snes-gamepad.mapping/kiwitata`: Button mapping for [SNES gamepads manufactured by Kiwitata](http://amzn.to/2pp29ab).
- `snes-gamepad.mapping/standard`: Button mapping for [SNES gamepads that follow the W3C spec](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/#remapping).

Pull requests for additional mappings are welcome!

## Single-Player Only

The SNES Gamepad library does not currently support multiple gamepads connected to the same computer.
